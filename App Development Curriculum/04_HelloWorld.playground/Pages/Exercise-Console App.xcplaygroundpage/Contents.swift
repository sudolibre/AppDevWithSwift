 ## Exercise: The Console App
 
 What kinds of messages can someone send to a console?
 
 You can peek at some of the messages other programmers decided to print on your Mac by opening Finder and going to Applications > Utilities > Console. You'll see a stream of text that looks like mostly nonsense. These are private messages among developers — who usually use in-group sayings that only people very familiar with each app will understand.
 
 Watch some messages scroll by, then go ahead and quit the Console app.
